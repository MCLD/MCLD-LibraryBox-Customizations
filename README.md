# LibraryBox Customizations at MCLD

:warning: **MCLD has retired our LibraryBox installations, this project will not be updated** :warning:

The Maricopa County Library District, working with Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, set up a library kiosk at the airport's baggage claim for people to charge their devices, pick up free books, and download eBooks from a LibraryBox on site. We felt that the default layout of the user interface on the LibraryBox could be improved so, using Bootstrap and custom code, we redesigned the interface into something more appealing.

The files contained in this repository can be added or substituted on LibraryBox 2.0 hardware and modified as necessary. We chose to stick with eBook offerings only, but the content could be expanded as desired.
